# üîç Scraper Plan & Rare Image Sourcing Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for sourcing high-quality and rare images that match our Visual Question Answering (VQA) taxonomy. The goal is to avoid scraping from overused search engines and instead focus on lesser-known, high-value sources.

---

## üéØ Strategy Summary

We will source images from:

1. **Manually Curated Archives**
   - Government and NGO data portals
   - Academic journal image sections
   - Language-specific sites (Korean, Japanese, Arabic)

2. **Deep Web Tools & Agents**
   - Cursor (for code-based assistance)
   - Windsurf (deep search AI)
   - DeepSearch via OpenAI API

3. **Fallback Methods**
   - DuckDuckGo + careful filters
   - Direct web scraping (via `requests`, `bs4`)
   - Public datasets like Flickr Commons
